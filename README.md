## Overview and Company History
 - Venmo is a mobile payment service that has been a subsidiary of PayPal since its acquisition, as part of Braintree, in December 2013
 - The company was founded in 2009.
 - Venmo was founded by college roommates Andrew Kortina and Iqram Magdon-Ismail. 
 - Venmo was first designed as a text message based Peer to Peer payment platform. It quickly transformed into the mobile app it operates as today. The idea was developed by Kortina and Magdon-Ismail as a solution to the inefficiencies of traditional Point Of Sale software. They also refer to a personal anecdote in which Magdon-Ismail was visiting Kortina in New York City and forgot his wallet back in Philadelphia. The process of settling their debt proved inconvenient, cementing their desire to disrupt traditional P2P payment services.
 - Company funding and acquisition history:
    - In 2010, the first round of seed capital was led by RRE Ventures, a venture capital firm based in New York, NY. Initial funding amounted to $1.2 million.
    - In 2012, Venmo was acquired by Braintree for $26.2 million. Braintree is a FinTech company based in Chicago, IL that specializes in mobile and web payment systems for e-commerce companies.
    - In 2013, as part of Braintree, Venmo was acquired by mobile payment giant and leader PayPal in a deal worth $800 million.

## Business Activities
- The company was founded as a way to simplify the process of sharing money between mobile users. Initially a text messaging payment service, Venmo pivoted to the use of a mobile app. The concept was developed in response to perceived inefficiences in the way people are able to split payments in traditional retail and hospitality settings.
- The intended customer of this service is anyone that has a need to send money to other mobile users. Specifically, it appeals to anyone previously frutrated by the inefficiencies of traditional P2P payment options(wire transfers, personal checks, cash) and offers them a payment option linked to their bank account or credit card of choice.
