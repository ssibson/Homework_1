## Overview and Company History
 - Venmo is a mobile payment service that has been a subsidiary of PayPal since its acquisition, as part of Braintree, in December 2013
 - The company was founded in 2009.
 - Venmo was founded by college roommates Andrew Kortina and Iqram Magdon-Ismail. 
 - Venmo was first designed as a text message based Peer to Peer payment platform. It quickly transformed into the mobile app it operates as today. The idea was developed by Kortina and Magdon-Ismail as a solution to the inefficiencies of traditional Point Of Sale software. They also refer to a personal anecdote in which Magdon-Ismail was visiting Kortina in New York City and forgot his wallet back in Philadelphia. The process of settling their debt proved inconvenient, cementing their desire to disrupt traditional P2P payment services.
 - Company funding and acquisition history:
    - In 2010, the first round of seed capital was led by RRE Ventures, a venture capital firm based in New York, NY. Initial funding amounted to $1.2 million.
    - In 2012, Venmo was acquired by Braintree for $26.2 million. Braintree is a FinTech company based in Chicago, IL that specializes in mobile and web payment systems for e-commerce companies.
    - In 2013, as part of Braintree, Venmo was acquired by mobile payment giant and leader PayPal in a deal worth $800 million.

## Business Activities
- The company was founded as a way to simplify the process of sharing money between mobile users. Initially a text messaging payment service, Venmo pivoted to the use of a mobile app. The concept was developed in response to perceived inefficiences in the way people are able to split payments in traditional retail and hospitality settings.
- The intended customer of this service is anyone that has a need to send money to other mobile users. Specifically, it appeals to anyone previously frutrated by the inefficiencies of traditional P2P payment options(wire transfers, personal checks, cash) and offers them a payment option linked to their bank account or credit card of choice. Venmo stands apart from its competitors in a number of ways. The focus on a social media type feed adds a social element not featured by its rivals. Additionally, they offer free transfers with a standard wait time of 1-3 business days, but also offer instant deposit with a fee of 1% or $10, whichever is less.

## Landscape
- Venmo operates primarily in the mobile payment field. They have also entered into the credit lending field with the introduction of the Venmo MasterCard.
- The major trends in mobile payment field have largely been driven by Venmo's introduction to the marketplace. Since its inception, the company has been on the leading edge of P2P mobile payment services. Their services include offering free transfers with a standard wait time, instant deposit with a small fee, online payment directly through Venmo and coupling of the Venmo app with other apps as a form of payment (Uber, Lyft, Grubhub, etc.)
- The company's key competitors in the realm of P2P payment applications, specifically, are Zelle and Square Cash, with all other applications and companies trailing considerably. When expanded to include mobile payment applications in general, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, Google Pay and other such digital wallet-focused applications enter the discussion.

## Results
- Venmo's impact in relation to P2P mobile payment apps cannot be understated. While no longer the industry leader by number of transactions or total dollar amount transferred, they still hold a strong share of the market. The leader in these transactions, Zelle, was developed by Early Warning Services at the behest of Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo in response to the public success of Venmo. Zelle has since added further large financial institutions BB&T, Capitol One, PNC Bank and US Bank to their list of ownership institutions. While Zelle is now the leader in funds transferred and number of transactions, Venmo's social impact and brand recognition are still the leader in the field. The use of the company's name as a verb cements their status of cultural significance.
    > "I'll Venmo you"
- In the mobile payment field, success is often measured by total payment volume, number of transactions, registered users and active users. By these metrics, Venmo performs admirably across the board. Considering total payment volume, Venmo is trending upward. Their service was used in transferring $31 billion in Q1 of 2020. The company is in a period of extended growth by this metric, rising every quarter since their Q1 2017 in which they saw a total payment volume of $6.8 billion. When considering the data for number of transactions, Venmo is again in a strong position. Their forecasted numbers for 2019 placed them second behind Zelle with 27.4 million individual transactions. Their strength is again displayed by their total active user account statistics. With 84.3 million users in the first quarter of 2010, they have shown remarkable growth to reach their 2019 Q3 total of 305 million active user accounts. By all metrics, Venmo has shown steady and continued growth, which positions them to continue in their role as an industry leader.
- As noted above, Venmo trails only Zelle and their considerable financial backing in the metrics associated with success in P2P mobile payment applications. Zelle records stronger numbers in total payment volume, number of transactions and active users, but trails Venmo in cultural and social impact. Square Cash is a distant third in all metrics.

## Recommendations
- Considering their strong standing and their forcasted continued growth with their current model, it is unlikey to see Venmo making wholesale changes to their business model. Given current trends, it may be wise for the company to look towards adapting their service to include transfer of Cryptocurrency on top of their standard money transfer options. 
- Adding a cryptocurrency transfer option would position Venmo well against companies like Zelle and Square Cash, whose innovations tend to be less drastic. Incorporating this service would indicate Venmo is staying technologically relevant and more progressive than their competitors. 
- The addition of a crypto trading service would require extensive blockchain development, but would likely be able to added to their current application without drastic changes. The company would need to develop a working relationship with Crypto Wallet providers in order for customers to link said wallets to their Venmo app and payment options.
- Rather than spending time developing their own Crypto Wallet service, it makes more sense for Venmo to develop working relationships with the established leaders in this field to avoid oversaturation. The technology needed to develop crypto transfers is already established in the communities that trust this form of currency. Adding this technology will encourage the growth of Cryptocurrency due to Venmo's cultural standing and generally accepted security policies.
